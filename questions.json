    "passage": "The shifting sands of the global economy have brought the concept of 'resilience' to the forefront of supply chain management. For decades, the dominant philosophy was 'just-in-time' efficiency, minimizing inventory and cutting costs. However, recent geopolitical upheavals and pandemics have exposed the fragility of this lean model. Resilience, in contrast, prioritizes redundancy and flexibility—sourcing from multiple geographies and holding buffer stocks. While this 'just-in-case' approach incurs higher holding costs, proponents argue it is an insurance premium worth paying against catastrophic disruptions. The transition is not merely operational but philosophical, requiring shareholders to accept lower short-term margins for long-term viability.",
